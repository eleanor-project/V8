# ELEANOR Router Configuration (Traffic Light)
# Notes:
# - Router decides whether to invoke ELEANOR governance (GREEN/AMBER/RED).
# - Router does not "judge" content; it routes based on risk, precedent coverage, and uncertainty proxies/telemetry.
# - Sanctity rule: human reviewers never override runtime decisions; they author future precedent only.
