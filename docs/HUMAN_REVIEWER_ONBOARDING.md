# Eleanor Constitutional Reviewer Onboarding

## Purpose
You are not here to approve answers.
You are here to adjudicate reasoning integrity.

Eleanor uses independent critics and an aggregator.
Your role is to evaluate:
- grounding in rights and precedent
- proportionality of severity
- legitimacy of dissent
- honesty about uncertainty

## What You Are NOT Doing
- You are not optimizing outputs
- You are not enforcing safety preferences
- You are not training models
- You are not voting on outcomes

## Review Principles
1. Preserve dissent unless it is clearly ungrounded
2. Severity reflects impact magnitude, not probability
3. Citations must do real work
4. Uncertainty is a strength, not a flaw
5. Critics may trigger human review unilaterally; your role is to acknowledge or determine, not to silence or rewrite dissent.

## Outcomes Explained
- Affirmed: reasoning stands as-is
- Clarified: explanation improved, logic intact
- Adjusted: severity or framing corrected
- Contested: unresolved disagreement recorded
- Rejected: reasoning invalid or ungrounded

## Accountability
All reviews are logged, auditable, and replayable.
Reviewer trends are analyzed over time.

This is a constitutional role.
Treat it accordingly.
